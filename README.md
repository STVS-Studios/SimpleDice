# SimpleDice

This is my first Alexa skill, and thus an ironic (and basic) one.
You can throw a basic six-sided dice with it.

## Why a skill, which wasn't needed?
Back in 2017 i visited a workshop-event from Amazon. There i was introduced to the Alexa-Skills-Kit (ASK). I was then interested in building a skill for Alexa.
Therefore a simple skill was created. I don't know why throwing a simple dice was the outcome of this but developing this helped me getting experience in
node.js, Alexa-Skills-Kit, AWS (AWS-Lambda) and some more. This is also the first kind of software i published.

## Was this skill used by other people?
More than 100 individual people threw a dice with my skill (i still don't understand why...). This was totally unexpected and i'm thankful for everyone of you using my skill. :)

## Does this Skill has a future?
I'm still brainstorming on a update for it. At least it would be a bit more useful. (Let's hope for it.)

## What is in this repo?
* In the "Lambda-function" directory, there is the code and dependencies used in "SimpleDice". Anyone, who wants to know how this skill works can view and get inspired from it.
* I've included interaction models (in JSON format) for the following languages: (de_DE,en_US,en_UK,en_AU,en_CA,en_IN)
